1. Download app folder  
2. Run _.exe_ file  
3. _Mouse click_ on grid to enable/disable cell  
4. Buttons: _play/pause simulation, change simulation speed, step next generation, kill all, random population, save current simulation, load simulation_  
5. Keyboard Controls: _g_ = change grid thickness, _c_ = change cell colors, _i_ = toggle dark/light theme
